   Use the task list here to ensure your repo is configured for this project. Do not skip any steps.

When you have the basic setup done, your repo structure should look something like:

city-explorer
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── public/
└── src/

Create a new repo called city-explorer on GitHub, initialized with no files.
Use create-react-app to setup a new React application named city-explorer in your local projects directory.
Connect your GitHub repo to your local repo using the directions on GitHub.
Convert the README.md file to be documentation regarding your lab and its current state of development. Check the "documentation" section of the lab assignment for more details on how that should look.
Deploy the basic react app to Netlify.
Install axios as a dependancy to your project using npm install axios
If you haven't already, procure a LocationIQ free-tier account. From the Dashboard, navigate to your API Access Tokens page. View, then Update the existing token, to change the label to "City Explorer". LocationIQ - Free Reverse Geocoding API, Geocoding API, Autocomplete API
Add your deployed Netlify app url as an HTTP Referrer to your API token settings. This step is necessary to prevent any unauthorized use of your token. Also add localhost while testing from your development environment.
Create an .env file: Your API key goes here for local development. Make sure this file is in your .gitignore.
Add your API key to your Netlify deployment. Under "Site settings" > "Build & deploy" > "Environment", you need to add "Edit variables" to add your API key, giving it the same name you used in your local .env file.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
